Swar Music: A Front-End Spotify Clone
This was a project I created during the first year of my college. At the time, it was a challenging experience, especially because I was new to JavaScript. I encountered many difficulties while trying to implement core functionalities like play, pause, and volume control. Despite these hurdles, it was a rewarding journey that helped me improve my coding skills and better understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS.

Overview:
Swar Music is a front-end clone of Spotify, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This music player features essential functionalities like play, pause, next/previous track, shuffle, download, and volume control, creating a basic yet interactive user experience. However, since this was an early project, there are some limitations, including the fact that it is not a single-page website and lacks responsiveness across devices.

Key Features:
1) Play and Pause Functionality:
  Users can easily play and pause the current track with clickable buttons, mimicking the core functionality of a typical music player.
2) Next and Previous Track:
  Navigation between songs is seamless with Next and Previous buttons, allowing users to move through the playlist without interruptions.
3) Shuffle Mode:
  A shuffle feature adds randomness to the playlist, giving users the ability to enjoy their music in a non-linear order.
4) Download Option:
  The music player offers a download button for each track, giving users the ability to download songs directly to their device.
5) Volume Control:
  Users can control the volume with a slider, adjusting the sound according to their preference.

Limitations:
1) Not a Single-Page Website:
  Swar Music is spread across multiple pages, as it does not utilize single-page application (SPA) techniques such as React or Vue.
2) Not Responsive:
  The project lacks media queries, so it is not responsive. This means the layout and functionality do not adapt well to different screen sizes or devices.
3) Login Page Doesn't Function:
  The login page is purely for show. While it contains input fields, entering details and clicking the login button simply redirects users to the next page, without any actual authentication or validation.

This project served as a great learning experience, especially in JavaScript. Despite its limitations, it marked an important milestone in my journey as a developer.
